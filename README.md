Refer the unit tests in [GoogleAuthHelperTest.java](https://github.com/theomails/googleauth-client/blob/main/googleauth-client/src/test/java/net/progressit/googleauthclient/GoogleAuthHelperTest.java) and then the comments in [GoogleOAuthHelper.java](https://github.com/theomails/googleauth-client/blob/main/googleauth-client/src/main/java/net/progressit/googleauthclient/GoogleOAuthHelper.java) to understand how this tiny library can help you.
